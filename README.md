# Landing Page Builder

Landing Page Builder is a visual editor for marketing teams to create, manage, and publish landing pages without writing code. Built as a Contentful integration, it powers responsive landing pages with a modern tech stack.

## What is this?

A drag-and-drop landing page editor that connects with Contentful CMS. Design teams can quickly assemble pages from pre-built components, preview them in real-time, and publish to production with zero developer involvement.

The project has two main parts:
1. An editor interface that runs within Contentful
2. A Next.js frontend that renders the published landing pages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Contentful account with API access
- Git

### Setup Process

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/landing-page-builder.git
cd landing-page-builder
npm install
```

Create your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your Contentful credentials:
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=abc123
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-delivery-token
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-preview-token
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=your-mgmt-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

This project is configured for seamless deployment on Vercel.

### Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account
2. Contentful space with appropriate content models
3. Required environment variables

### Deployment Steps

   ```

4. Click "Deploy"

### Troubleshooting Deployment

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check environment variables are correctly configured
2. Ensure Contentful API is accessible
3. Verify content models match expected schema
4. Increase function memory if needed in `vercel.json`

## üìù Contentful Setup

### Content Models Required

1. **Landing Page**
   - Title (Short text)
   - Slug (Short text, unique)
   - Layout Config (JSON object)

2. **Asset Management**
   - Upload images to Contentful Media Library
   - Use Contentful's image optimization features

### GraphQL Schema
The application uses Contentful's GraphQL API to fetch:
- Landing page configurations
- Associated media assets
- Component data

## Contentful Content Model Requirements

For this application to work correctly with your Contentful space, you need to have the following content types and fields defined:

### Content Type: landingPage
Required fields:
- `title` (Short text)
- `slug` (Short text) - This is used for the URL path
- `layoutConfig` (JSON object) - Contains the page structure
- `heroBlock` (Reference to Hero Block)
- `twoColumnRow` (Reference to Two Column Row)
- `imageGrid` (Reference to Image Grid)

### Content Type: heroBlock
Required fields:
- `heading` (Short text)
- `subtitle` (Short text)
- `ctaText` (Short text)
- `ctaUrl` (Short text)
- `backgroundImage` (Media - Image)

### Content Type: twoColumnRow
Required fields:
- `leftHeading` (Short text)
- `leftSubtitle` (Long text)
- `leftCtaText` (Short text)
- `leftCtaUrl` (Short text)
- `rightImage` (Media - Image)

### Content Type: imageGrid
Required fields:
- `images` (Media - Images, Multiple references)

> **Note**: If your Contentful content model differs from this structure, you'll need to update the GraphQL queries in `lib/contentful.ts` and the TypeScript interfaces in `types/contentful.ts`.
